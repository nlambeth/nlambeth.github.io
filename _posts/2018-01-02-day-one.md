I've been procrastinating on setting up a personal website for long enough. github
pages and Jekyll seemed easy--github is free, and Jekyll is lightweight and built-in.
Sounds good to me!

Errata:
1. This code is forked from https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme
2. Currently working in the Cloud9 IDE, works great on my chromebook!
