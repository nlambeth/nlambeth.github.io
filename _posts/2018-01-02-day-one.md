I've been procrastinating on setting up a personal website for long enough. github
pages and Jekyll seemed easy--github is free, and Jekyll is lightweight and built-in.
Sounds good to me!

Errata:
1. This code is forked from [link](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme)
2. Currently working in the Cloud9 IDE, works great on my chromebook!
3. Remember your git commands:
    * git add --all
    * git commit -m "message"
    * git push -u origin master"
4. Set git url for nlambeth.github.io from HTTPS to SSH:
    * cd to project directory
    * git remote -v
    * git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY
    * git remote -v
